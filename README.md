# UUfluxproc
Scripts and functions to ingest NEON (and other) flux data sources, perform QAQC, and plot time series and functional relationships.

Code remains under development - as a result, it would be good practice for the near future to reinstall the package using devtools::install_github("rfiorella/UUfluxproc") every time you work with the package after there have been updates.

Please report bugs as issues so they can be traced.
